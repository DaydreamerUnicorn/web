This Code of Conduct/Anti-Harassment & Discrimination Policy is specifically for
the Ory Summit 2021, but applies generally to all events hosted by Ory.

# Virtual Conference Anti-Harassment & Discrimination Policy

Ory Summit is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual
language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including
talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers. Our
anti-harassment policy can be found at:

> https://www.ory.sh/code-of-conduct

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
  physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

**Enforcement**

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the
right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all
participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the
conference.

Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the
clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any
participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and
event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules
outside event activities too!

**Anonymous Report**

> Make an anonymous report
> [by filling out this form](https://form.typeform.com/to/sZwnG09j).

We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully
investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

**Personal Report**

You can make a personal report by:

> Message us directly at the
> [Help Desk Booth](https://events.hubilo.com/ory-summit/booth/105409) or
> message Ory Staff in #ory-summit in the
> [Ory Community Slack](https://slack.ory.sh).

> Message this email address: office+summit@ory.sh. It will be continuously
> monitored for the duration of the event.

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be
overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed
properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be
upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring
someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell
anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event.
We value your attendance.
