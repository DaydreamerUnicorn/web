title: Open Source License Compliance and Ory Open Source
description: |
  Our recent audit showed that Ory’s open source code base is “clean” i.e. poses
  no intellectual property risks to its users (within the limits of what our tools can
  identify). Still, users, and in particular vendors, need to understand the license
  obligations open source code puts on them. In this talk, I will review Ory from a
  license compliance perspective and how users/vendors should think about it.
