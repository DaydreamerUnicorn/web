title: Ory Cloud Technical Direction
description: |
  Ory has a vision for the future: building a global, multi-cloud architecture set-up of Ory Cloud that uses different cloud providers. Andreas Bucksteeg will discuss this vision and questions such as: “How can we deploy and manage these services using GitHub principles?” and “How do we route traffic globally through the different clusters?”
