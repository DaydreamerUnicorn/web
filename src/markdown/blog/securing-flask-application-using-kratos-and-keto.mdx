In this blog post, I will show you an example of how you can secure your homepage using Ory Kratos and Ory Keto. The Flask application will have the following flow for authorization:

1. A user opens a homepage
2. Flask view gets 'ory_kratos_session' value from request cookie
3. Restrict access to the homepage if the user is inactive
4. Get the user's identity from Kratos
5. Restrict access to the homepage if we have no user's identity from Kratos
6. Restrict access to the homepage if access is not allowed by Keto
