Software engineers write code. This code goes to production and is used by end-users. Sometimes even the perfect and clean code has bugs, and some of them can be security issues. Hence, every software engineer who writes code for end-users needs to care about their code's security.

One needs to think differently to write robust and secure programs. You can look at the following list of reasons that could go wrong with your application:

- Hardware can die. You can catch a kernel panic, RAM or SSD can die eventually, and systems crash. You need to have recovery mechanisms in that case or enable redundant services in your infrastructure. These cases are simple because you can have [a long-term corrupted data](https://www.pgcon.org/2017/schedule/attachments/453_corruption-pgcon-2017.pdf)
- Netsplits
- Cascade errors
- Time is relative
- Messages can be missing.
- Deadlocks
- Malicious nodes
- Messages can duplicate
- No guarantees about order and time of delivery

Same thing with security issues. Security can be challenging, and modern application development framework gives you some hints to go with to establish your boundaries

- What are your business priorities?
- What is the worst possible scenario?
- What are your immovable constraints?
- What data is this solution storing/processing?
- What skills does your team have?
- What is the timeline for the project?

You need to draw a line and have boundaries because one can get unmaintainable code in a couple of months. We have established boundaries, and let's look at possible attack vectors to our authentication service.

## Attack vectors

Let's look at the information sponsor of almost all blog posts on the internet, also known as Wikipedia.
In computer security, an attack vector is a specific path, method, or scenario that can be exploited to break into an IT system, thus compromising its security.
An attack vector may be exploited manually, automatically, or through a combination of manual and automatic activity.
Often, this is a multi-step process. For instance, malicious code (code that the user did not consent to being run and that performs actions the user would not consent to) often operates by being added to a harmless seeming document made available to an end user. When the unsuspecting end user opens the document, the malicious code in question (known as the payload) is executed and performs the abusive tasks it was programmed to execute, which may include things such as spreading itself further, opening up unauthorized access to the IT system, stealing or encrypting the user's documents, etc.

## Password guessing

- bruteforce (next auth delay, password strength check)
- Dictionary guessing (Antifraud service, password strength check)
- Rainbow tables (bcrypt, correct usage of salt)

## Data interception

- Wifi sniffing (SSL)
- MitM interception (SSL)
- keylogger (copying of input) (2FA)
- Screen spying (2FA)
- cookie leak (XSS or virus/trojan) (oauth2/short cookie lifetime, privilegies separation)
- SSL vulnerabilities (security audit, periodical check of SSL configuration) (Shout out to compliances)

## Phishing attacks

- Phishing pages (Bind cookie to user ip)
- MitM interception (SSL, PKP, HSTS) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning)
- DNS poison (SSL, PKP, HSTS)
- Browser poison (2FA OCRA+TDS)
-  "Connect" request interception (CSRF token on auth forms )

## Social Engineering

- 2FA leak (notifications about user's activity, antifraud, access blocking procedure)
- Password leak (2FA, oauth2)
- Access recovery (Access recovery)
- Device stealing (block/allow access procedures)

## inner threats

- sessions leak from server (short session lifetime)
- passwords database leak from server (bcrypt, correct usage of salt)
- inner interception of network traffic (SSL usage between services, key and certificates management, certificate short lifetime)
- logfiles leak from server (logs filtration, masking of passwords and personal data)
