Software engineers write code. This code goes to production and is used by end-users. Sometimes even the perfect and clean code has bugs, and some of them can be security issues. Hence, every software engineer who writes code for end-users needs to care about their code's security.
One needs to think differently to write robust and secure programs. This article shows the most common attack vectors to authentication services and how to avoid data security breaches.

## What is an attack vector and attack surface
An attack vector is a path that a hacker takes to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities. In contrast, an attack surface is all of the public and privately exposed nexus points of your company's data and human or software interaction. Let's start with password guessing

## Password guessing

Bruteforce attack is a simple and powerful way to gain access for an unauthorized user. Usually, enumeration is a key, and it's simply an automated way to check different credentials and find credentials that give you access to the system.

There are different types of brute force attacks performed by a hacker. For instance, a simple bruteforce attack does not use any software, and a hacker enters credentials manually. The next level of this type of attack is dictionary attacks. In that case, a hacker can use scripts to perform an attack and dictionaries of the most commonly used passwords.

To avoid data breaches on your system, one should implement the next authentication delay and password strength check. in addition, a good idea can be to implement a feature to check user's passwords in leaked databases. https://haveibeenpwned.com/ can be an excellent candidate to integrate with.

In the worst-case scenario, password hashes can leak from for database. An attacker can use rainbow tables to crack passwords. The rainbow table itself refers to a precomputed table that contains the password hash value for each plain text character used during the authentication process. If hackers gain access to the list of password hashes, they can crack all passwords very quickly with a rainbow table.

Usage of salt and strong hashing algorithm can reduce risk of leaking passwords.

Key takeaways to summarize this part

- Use next authentication delay. Implement exponental back-off for failed attempts
- Check password strength
- Use bcrypt/Argon2 or any other strong hashing algorithm with correcy usage of salt

Let's continue with the next type of attack

## Data interception

- Wifi sniffing (SSL)
- MitM interception (SSL)
- keylogger (copying of input) (2FA)
- Screen spying (2FA)
- cookie leak (XSS or virus/trojan) (oauth2/short cookie lifetime, privilegies separation)
- SSL vulnerabilities (security audit, periodical check of SSL configuration) (Shout out to compliances)

## Phishing attacks

- Phishing pages (Bind cookie to user ip)
- MitM interception (SSL, PKP, HSTS) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning)
- DNS poison (SSL, PKP, HSTS)
- Browser poison (2FA OCRA+TDS)
-  "Connect" request interception (CSRF token on auth forms )

## Social Engineering

- 2FA leak (notifications about user's activity, antifraud, access blocking procedure)
- Password leak (2FA, oauth2)
- Access recovery (Access recovery)
- Device stealing (block/allow access procedures)

## inner threats

- sessions leak from server (short session lifetime)
- passwords database leak from server (bcrypt, correct usage of salt)
- inner interception of network traffic (SSL usage between services, key and certificates management, certificate short lifetime)
- logfiles leak from server (logs filtration, masking of passwords and personal data)

You need to draw a line and have boundaries because one can get unmaintainable code in a couple of months. We have established boundaries, and let's look at possible attack vectors to our authentication service.
