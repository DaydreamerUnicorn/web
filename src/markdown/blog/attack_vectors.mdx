## Intro

## Attack vectors and how to defend them

## Password guessing

- bruteforce (next auth delay, password strength check)
- Dictionary guessing (Antifraud service, password strength check)
- Rainbow tables (bcrypt, correct usage of salt)

## Data interception

- Wifi sniffing (SSL)
- MitM interception (SSL)
- keylogger (copying of input) (2FA)
- Screen spying (2FA)
- cookie leak (XSS or virus/trojan) (oauth2/short cookie lifetime, privilegies separation)
- SSL vulnerabilities (security audit, periodical check of SSL configuration) (Shout out to compliances)

## Phishing attacks

- Phishing pages (Bind cookie to user ip)
- MitM interception (SSL, PKP, HSTS) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning)
- DNS poison (SSL, PKP, HSTS)
- Browser poison (2FA OCRA+TDS)
-  "Connect" request interception (CSRF token on auth forms )

## Social Engineering

- 2FA leak (notifications about user's activity, antifraud, access blocking procedure)
- Password leak (2FA, oauth2)
- Access recovery (Access recovery)
- Device stealing (block/allow access procedures)

## inner threats

- sessions leak from server (short session lifetime)
- passwords database leak from server (bcrypt, correct usage of salt)
- inner interception of network traffic (SSL usage between services, key and certificates management, certificate short lifetime)
- logfiles leak from server (logs filtration, masking of passwords and personal data)
